But deep down, you've always known... there has to be more. More truth, happiness, beauty and meaning to the way we live and care. The truth is that science has always been there. But healthcare never touched it as it is over-romanticised in the name of saving lives. So, what would you do if someone told you that this same science that healthcare ignores ironically has the power to heal killer diseases that are considered untreatable today. We have built a platform to identify such science, refine it and take it to humanity. Evidence-backed. Time-tested. This means you donʼt have to wait around anymore. At Amura, Doctors start treating real patients from day one. Each doctor manages 150+ patients with full autonomy, in their own time, making their own calls. This is your practice for the taking. Today. Who are we? Interestingly, in your own corner of the world, a hardworking team bent on hyper-excellence has quietly built a new way of medicine, a platform built on science, story, and soul. Think of Amura as a \"hospital on the cloud.\" We help people achieve the best standard of health they possibly can, taking full responsibility for their journey. We're a team of curious, ambitious individuals across all fields of work. Here, Doctors work alongside health coaches, designers, engineers, writers, and even filmmakers. A cloud can reach anywhere and so can we. Your patients will be from all over the world, and you will change lives globally from your new home in Chennai. Over the last 8 years we have helped tens of thousands of people live better lives across 45 countries. What you'll actually be doing: Talking to real patients every day. Understanding their stories, their symptoms, and their goals. Soon you will be your patient's friend, with a personal connection that most Doctors are unable to have. Ordering tests, interpreting blood reports, and building holistic diagnoses. Creating and updating personalised care plans—nutrition, supplementation, sleep, stress, the works. Handling flare-ups, doubts, frustrations, and celebrations. Learning. A lot. Every week. With your peers, mentors, and specialists. And yes, you'll get to master the old-school art of taking history, and apply it in a very new-school way. You'll also have regular training sessions to sharpen your clinical and communication skills. Life at Amura. We know the job description is supposed to sell you the role. But honestly, we cannot wait to tell you how much your life will change here. We don't think anything like this exists anywhere in the world. This isn't a hospital job or a clinic gig. It's a new kind of doctor's life. You will learn new concepts, new skills and new ways of thinking but more than anything you will learn to belong. Amura Doctors are not just colleagues, they are friends, maybe even family. They are a group of young minds working together to change health care forever. You will learn from them and you will help them learn. There is no hierarchy, no toxicity, no judgement. You are not a junior or a senior Doctor but a Doctor respected for who you are. At Amura, we have career maps instead of ladders. You get to choose how you explore and expand. It took us 8 years to build. And now we are ready to take it to 8 billion people. You are an Amurite if: You want to treat patients from day one and be trusted to do it. You're curious, open-minded, and hungry to learn fast through real practical work. You believe medicine is about people, not prescriptions. You're excited by the idea of unlearning old rules and shaping something new. And most importantly, you want your first job to feel like it actually means something.
